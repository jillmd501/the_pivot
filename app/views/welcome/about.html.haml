              Upon graduation from the University of South Carolina, I decided to buy a one way ticket to Colorado - that was three years ago. Living the ski bum life in Vail for two years has me trading my sundresses and cowboy boots in for beanies and flannel.  My perfect day would be spent frolicking in the mountains, getting my heart rate up on a good hike, and ending the day with beer and friends.

              Ross comes from the best state in the country; New Jersey. Some say Ross was born with hair on his chest and a beer in his hand. At a young age he picked up the miraculous sport of diving, and traveled to Denver, Colorado to pursue his passion as a Division I Athete for the University of Denver. Now Ross attends The Turing School for Software & Design in hopes of becoming a full-stack web developer
